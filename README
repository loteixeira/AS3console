* Introduction:
AS3Console is a small and non-intrusive logging component for Actionscript3 language (Flash, Flex and AIR).
The component is a singleton that inherits from EventDispatcher class where you can listen for data input and output.
It has a customizable behavior and is easy to remove from release versions (avoiding overhead when it isn't used).
Using this component you don't need to install any plugin for your browser or any application on your computer.
It's embedded to the SWF/SWC file and can be accessed from any computer using shortcut keys.

* Usage example:
Console.create(stage);
cpln("Testing...");

* Activating CodeEval plugin:
Console.create(stage);
CodeEval.start();
cpln("Testing...");
